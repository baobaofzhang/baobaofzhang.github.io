## Dissertation

My PhD dissertation "[Three Essays on the Politics of American Social Programs](https://thesiscommons.org/7aytg/)" presents experimental and quasi-experimental studies that examined the drivers of Americans' attitudes toward social programs. The first and second essays sought to understand how benefiting social programs (e.g., Medicare and governmental scholarships) affected voters\' political attitudes and behavior, a process termed policy feedback. The third essay investigated how expert forecasts about automation's potential impact shaped Americans' beliefs about the future of work and preferences for governmental response.
