    "text": "The best way to contact me is at the email address above. Arcadia Science is reimagining scientific publishing and does not publish our work in traditional peer-reviewed journals. Therefore, I do not accept requests to review for peer-reviewed journals. However, Arcadia Science regularly engages in reviewing preprints and posting public comments. You can view the public comments I’ve made on preprints through Hypothesis. If you have a preprint that you think I might be interested in reviewing, please email me with the preprint link and I will do my best to review it and post a public comment. My expertise spans environmental microbiology and computational biology, with specific emphasis on microbial ecology of engineered water systems and multi-omics approaches.\nDuring my PhD and postdoc, I was incredibly dedicated to practicing reproducible and open research by publicly providing associated code and datasets with each of my publications. For each manuscript on my Publications page, I have provided a PDF copy for download, links to code workflows available on Github, datasets on Figshare, and/or genomes/meta-omics datasets available on NCBI. Should you have any problems downloading a manuscript that may be behind a paywall for you, or have any questions about my code/datasets, please do not hesitate to contact me at the email address above."

The third essay investigated how expert forecasts about automation’s potential impact shaped Americans’ beliefs about the future of work and preferences for governmental response."

    "text": "Teaching\n\nGovernance and Ethics of Artificial Intelligence\nI am currently teaching “Governance and Ethics of Artificial Intelligence” at Syracuse University. It is an upper-level undergraduate seminar that I designed.\nThis class uses a cross-disciplinary approach to study how tech companies, national governments, international organizations, and civil society groups could manage the development and deployment of AI in the public interest. The class material draws upon research in political science, public policy, philosophy, legal studies, economics, and computer science. Topics include algorithmic fairness; privacy, transparency, and safety; automation and the future of work; the impact of AI on international security.\nIn recent years, the ethics of AI has become a burgeoning field of study, with various institutions articulating AI ethics principles. But as tech companies and governmental bodies seek to implement policies to manage the technology, how to govern AI has become a deeply political question. While this class touches on the central debates in AI ethics, it emphasizes the political and public policy dimensions of AI governance.\nCourse Syllabus\n\n\nIntroduction to American Politics\nI taught “Introduction to American Politics” during Yale Summer Session 2018. In my role as lecturer, I designed the syllabus, delivered lectures, led interactive workshops, and evaluated all student works.\nThe course was an introduction to the study of American government and politics. In five short weeks, the course covered a wide range of topics, including the constitutional foundations of the U.S., political institutions, mass politics, the media, political parties, and interest groups. Students explored other topics of interest to them through essay assignments. Besides acquiring substantive knowledge about American politics, students also learned how to think like political scientists by reading and discussing contemporary works in the discipline.\nCourse Syllabus\n\n\n\nMentoring\nIf you would like me to write you a letter of recommendation, please email me at least two weeks before the deadline. If I agree to write you a letter of recommendation, please fill out this Google Form to provide me the necessary information to write you the letter of recommendation. Thank you!"
